Blink is a micro web framework for building long-running and high performance services, the design heavily inspired by Yii2
and Laravel. Blink aims to provide the most expressive and elegant API and try to make the experience of web development
as pleasant as possible.

Besides, Blink is also an application server that can serve requests directly in PHP, without php-fpm or Apache's mod_php.
we use the [Swoole extension](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) as the underlying networking library. This can easily make
our PHP application 100% faster in just a blink.

## Why build this?

In php-fpm or mod_php, all resources like objects and database connections only live within a single request,
all these resources will be freed once the request terminates. This works fine with simple applications without
much traffic, but for large scale applications, the performance impact of reallocating resources on every request
is really huge.

Because of this, we are always trying to find a way to reduce unnecessary resources reallocating on every request, and
I'm finally very glad to announce that **Blink** is exactly the answer!
